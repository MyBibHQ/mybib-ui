# MyBib-ui

[MyBib](https://www.mybib.com) is a fast, free, and easy-to-use bibliography generator for the web (desktop, laptop, and mobile).

**MyBib-ui** is the web frontend component of MyBib, designed for users on desktop and laptop devices.

We use Vue.js to keep things slick, including Vuex for state management. Muse UI for Material Design components, and Webpack to bring it all together.
